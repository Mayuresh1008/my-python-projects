A classic beginner-level **Python project** that lets you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer — featuring fun **ASCII art graphics** and simple game logic 🕹️

## 🎮 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to choose:  
   `0 = Rock`, `1 = Paper`, `2 = Scissors`

2. The computer randomly selects its choice

3. ASCII art is displayed for both choices

4. The winner is determined based on standard game rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Paper beats Rock  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Same choice = Draw

5. If an invalid input is given, the game ends immediately ❌
